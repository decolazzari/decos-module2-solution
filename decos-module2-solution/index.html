			<div class="p1">
				Sushi is really interesting because they put a slice of raw fish over some rice. These guys have an unexplained magic in their hands, how come a little slice of raw fish over some glued rice can be so delicious?? I can't explain, even Einstein and Freud couldn't explain this, nobody can. It reminds me my therapist once said to me: DON'T THINK, JUST FEEL!!!

			<div class="p2">
				Nobody can deny, once upon a time there was a strange rounded and yellowish-light-brown thing called potato, sometimes it can be purpleish a little. The amazing thing is that you can make anything you want with it: toast, cooked, boiled, fried, smashed, dried, never forget the "swiss potato" (G"d forgive me!!) ... and put on it every kind of spice, souces, cheeses...

			<div class="p3">
				My mom is a master of cooking. Has anyone tried her potato pie with italian stuffing: Cheese, tomato, oregano and olive oil? Well, I suggest trying at least making some in your home, you won't be regreted. The best time is when I make the pasta, handmade, and she prepares the tomato souce, we must call some friends to join the "cantina" we make at home!
